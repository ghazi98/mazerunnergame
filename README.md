# The Maze Runner Game
This project focuses on replicating a Maze Runner Game. This project intends on establishing an interactive and entertaining game experience for all ages.
# Motivation
With technology advancing at a rapid pace, the price of laptops has increased, this can be hard for people who simply want to play games. Most games also require complex configuration, large download files and demand high specifications to run. I have designed a game that is easy to implement and run, which is also able to run on low specification hardware and most importantlyâ€¦ it is fun!
# Tech/framework used: Eclipse, Python.
